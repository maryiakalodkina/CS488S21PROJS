 
 For Q2 we assume that the expected latency would be 177.519 ms as that is what 
we get if we sum up L1 avg rtt (86.797 ms), L2 avg rtt (25.667 ms), 
L3 avg rtt (65.056 ms).
 Actual measured latency (avg RRT) is 172.309 ms. 

 For Q2 we assume that the expected throughput would be the sum of 3 bandwidth
of L1,L2 and L3 (11.1637 Mbps + 33.3079 Mbps + 24.7955 Mbps) divided by 3, which would 
give us 23.0890 Mbps 
 Actual measured throughput is 18.2243 Mbps. The actual throughtput is lower 
than the expected throughput as it can be affected by many factors like 
latency, transmission medium limitation, etc.
